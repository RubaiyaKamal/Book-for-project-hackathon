# Strategic Plan - Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Content Generation Strategy

### Content Authorship Distribution
- **5% Writer-Created Content**: High-level structure, learning objectives, key concepts outline
- **95% AI-Generated Content**: Detailed explanations, examples, code implementations, diagrams, and comprehensive chapter content using Context7

### AI Content Generation Approach
The book content will be primarily generated by AI agents leveraging Context7 to ensure:
- Consistency across all modules and chapters
- Up-to-date technical information and best practices
- Comprehensive coverage of topics with depth and clarity
- Integration of practical examples and real-world applications

## Content Requirements for Every Chapter

### Mandatory Elements
Each chapter MUST include:

1. **Code Examples**
   - Practical, runnable code snippets
   - Multiple programming languages where applicable (Python, C++, ROS)
   - Well-commented and explained code blocks
   - Progressive complexity from basic to advanced

2. **Diagrams and Visual Aids**
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Flowcharts for algorithms and processes
   - System integration diagrams
   - Conceptual illustrations
   - Mermaid diagrams for workflows
   - Visual representations of mathematical concepts

3. **Hands-on Demonstrations**
   - Step-by-step tutorials
   - Real-world use cases
   - Troubleshooting guides

## Writer Responsibilities (5%)
