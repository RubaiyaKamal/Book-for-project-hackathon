# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of AI

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## Course Goal

**Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body.** You'll apply your AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. ✅ **Understand Physical AI principles** and embodied intelligence
2. ✅ **Master ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
3. ✅ **Simulate robots** with Gazebo and Unity
4. ✅ **Develop with NVIDIA Isaac** AI robot platform
5. ✅ **Design humanoid robots** for natural interactions
6. ✅ **Integrate GPT models** for conversational robotics

## Course Structure

This course is organized into **4 modules** spanning **13 weeks**:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Weeks 1-5** | Focus: Middleware for robot control

Learn the foundation of robot software architecture:
- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Weeks 6-7** | Focus: Physics simulation and environment building

Master simulation environments:
- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
**Weeks 8-10** | Focus: Advanced perception and training

Dive into AI-powered robotics:
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation
- Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Weeks 11-13** | Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics

Bring it all together:
- Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions
- **Capstone Project**: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

Your final project brings together everything you've learned:

> A simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.

This project demonstrates the full pipeline from language understanding to physical action.

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- **Programming**: Python (intermediate level)
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, basic calculus
- **AI/ML**: Understanding of neural networks and machine learning concepts

### Recommended Background
- Experience with Linux/Ubuntu
- Familiarity with computer vision concepts
- Basic understanding of robotics (helpful but not required)

## Hardware Requirements

:::warning Important
This course is technically demanding. It sits at the intersection of three heavy computational loads: **Physics Simulation**, **Visual Perception**, and **Generative AI**.
:::

### Minimum Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM) or higher
- **CPU**: Intel Core i7 (13th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 9
- **RAM**: 64 GB DDR5 (32 GB absolute minimum)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

For detailed hardware specifications and budget options, see the [Hardware Requirements](/docs/hardware/workstation-requirements) section.

## Assessments

Your learning will be evaluated through:

1. **ROS 2 Package Development Project** (Week 5)
2. **Gazebo Simulation Implementation** (Week 7)
3. **Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline** (Week 10)
4. **Capstone: Simulated Humanoid with Conversational AI** (Week 13)

## Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- **Hands-on Learning**: Build real projects, not just theory
- **Industry-Standard Tools**: ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, industry best practices
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Learn to bridge simulation and reality
- **AI Integration**: Combine traditional robotics with modern AI
